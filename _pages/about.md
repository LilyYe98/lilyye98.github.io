I am Li Ye, graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor with a Master's degree in Bioinformatics in year 2023, and currently is working as a Data Engineer at Aptiv, a leader in the automotive industry. Programming is not just my job but also my hobby â€” I love creating small, personal projects that solve everyday problems.

When I'm not at work, you'll likely find me outdoors with my camera, capturing the beauty of nature through my lens. Photography not only fuels my creative side but also enhances my attention to detail. Additionally, I enjoy hiking and exploring new trails, which helps me stay physically active and mentally refreshed. Regular workouts are also a key part of my routine, keeping me energized and focused.
